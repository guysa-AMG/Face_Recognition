# Face Recognition
A Python-based face recognition and detection toolkit built with OpenCV and deep learning libraries.
This project allows you to detect faces in images and video, recognize known individuals, and experiment with different models and preprocessing techniques to improve accuracy.

Key Features:

Real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar cascades

Face recognition using face_recognition and dlib embeddings

Support for webcam and image input

Utilities for creating and managing face datasets

Modular design for testing and experimenting with different models
